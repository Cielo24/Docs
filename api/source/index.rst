cielo24 Web Services Platform API
===================================

The cielo24 Web Services Platform API allows developers to easily integrate transcription, captioning and keyword extraction into their applications without having to use a manual web portal.
The API is partially asynchronous in that the results are not always available immediately. Many of the cielo24 services require time to process, and once complete, the third-party application can either be notified via a web callback or the application can poll the interface to determine if the submitted request has been completed.
